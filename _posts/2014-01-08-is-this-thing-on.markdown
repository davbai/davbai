title:  "Is This Thing On?"

So I _finally_ got around to creating a blog. It's something that I've been meaning to do but never got around to it. And even better I was able to get the domain I wanted (I swear I've tried to get [davbai.com](http://www.davbai.com) before and it was taken). I created this site using [Jekyll](http://www.http://jekyllrb.com/) and it's hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/davbai/davbai.github.io). After considering other various options, this seemed to give me a good balance between ease of use and customizability.

It's only by coincidence that it's the beginning of the new year that I did this. This isn't some New Year's Resolution where I'm telling myself I'm going to write more or anything. I don't know how I exactly feel about New Year's Resolutions. On one hand the end of the calendar year is a good time to reflect on the pass twelve months and make adjustments going into the new year. But on the other hand, I think self-reflection and checkpoints can and probably should be made periodically  throughout the year. And if there is something that you _really_ want to do differently, you shouldn't have to or need to wait till the beginning of the year to do it.
