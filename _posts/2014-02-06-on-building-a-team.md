title:  "On Building a Team"

Daniel Wood, [The Bleacher Report](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1165320-2012-nfl-draft-grades-power-ranking-teams-that-failed-on-draft-day) (2012):

*After one of the worst picks in the first round I can ever remember, the Seattle Seahawks didn't draft any positions of need or draft for the future.*

*Pete Carroll is proving why he didn’t make it in the NFL the first time. Not only was Bruce Irvin a reach at No. 15, the Seahawks proved they were oblivious to their madness by celebrating their selection.*

*As if the day wasn’t bad enough, Seattle selecting Russell Wilson, a QB that doesn’t fit their offense at all, was by far the worst move of the draft. With the two worst moves of the draft, Seattle is the only team that received an F on draft day.*

Fastforward to 2014. Seahawks are Super Bowl XLVIII Champions, Russell Wilson is 28-9 in first two years in the NFL, and Bruce Irvin is a part of the [#1 defense](http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/team/_/stat/total/position/defense) in the league. Led by a quarterback that many said wouldn't make it in the NFL and a number of [undrafted free agents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undrafted_free_agent#Undrafted_free_agent), the Seahawks proved that there is more to succeeding then attracting the best talent out there. Coaches, general managers, and owners that are able to spot the untapped potential and drive in a lot of the younger athletes, are able to acquire extremely hungry and motivated players, which play to the advantages of both parties.

Building a team is hard. Building a great is even harder. In the tech industry, there has been an infatuation with only recruiting "the best", "A-players", "rockstars". You get all these companies that have have walled themselves off from a lot of great candidates due to a what they would call a *high standard*, but in reality they are *restrictions* that severely limit the talent pool they can choose from (BS form a top tier college, high GPAs, years of experience in language/tool X). Now don't get me wrong, these are obviously valid indictors. But if you limit yourself to *only* these standards, you miss out on a lot of others that could also add huge value to your company or team. 

I agree that all the Googles, Facebooks, Microsofts, all have a tremendous amount of talent. What I would argue is they lose out on a lot of other great people due to a process that could use improvements. For a team to succeed, you don't always need the best people, but the *right* people. If you assembled a team of "A-players" but the team isn't a sum of its parts, then whats the point? If the team is lacking a synergy or cohesiveness that is required to consistently produce, then whats the point? 

Who cares if a candidate for a position knows Git or not. If they're familiar with source control, I'm sure they can pick it up. There might be a slight learning curve, but don't rule someone out because of a "requirement" like this. Someone that is familiar with and knowledgable of your whole stack will probably be able to dive right in, but on the other hand if you have someone willing to learn and is naturally **curious** and/or **passionate** about the product or service you're creating, that can be just as valuable, if not more valuable than the former.

The next time you're reviewing candidates and deem someone not fit for a role, ask yourself, are they really not right for the job, or just an undrafted free agent ready to be the next superstar for your team?
