title:  "Presentation Best Practices"
---

I've seen my fair share of good and bad presentations. Its always a difficult task to try to follow someone that is unprepared or not clearly articulating their points. After being asked to help out a colleague with their presentation skills and give some pointers on how to effectively convey ideas, I took this chance to document some of my best practices. Whether its presenting a project, explaining a concept, or proposing a new tool/process, there are a few guidelines that I tend to follow to help make sure my presentations effective and useful. 

### Have Concise PowerPoints
PowerPoints can be a powerful tool but they can also bog down a presentation. The key is to have the right balance. I'm a firm believer that having slides can be beneficial to both the attendees, as well as the presenter. If done right, they can provide structure and help people follow along.

We've all seen the presentation where the PowerPoint starts and each slide is a wall of text. Not only is it hard to read, but trying to comprehend what you're reading, and listening to the speaker at the same time is almost impossible.

Slides, if you decide to have them, should be concise and too the point. Bullet points are great for giving a preview of what you're going to say. By not having too much text, it will allow people to quickly scan the next bullet/title to see what's coming up next and then direct their attention right back at you. If I have a list of items, most of the time I have each bullet appear one at a time (only appearing after I'm ready to talk about the next point). This makes it so that there are only a few new words/sentences that appear on screen for the audience to consume. 

### Follow an Outline
This is more of a personal preference, but for me having a  brief outline of my presentation in front of me keeps me from deviating, ensure that I hit every point I intended to, and make sure I follow a logical progression. If you have notes to reference off of, you'll want to avoid full paragraphs/sentences otherwise you might fall into a trap of just reading off your paper (*remember eye contact!*).

### Enthusiasm!
Recently a peer asked me how he'd be able to convince his team to adopt a new tool and process, even though it has its known advantages, because people might be reluctant to put in the extra work up-front to get it up and running, and go out of their comfort zone.

Sometimes all it takes is a little enthusiasm. By showing some passion in your ideas/project/design/whatever, it'll be easier to get your audience interested. Be cautious of setting a tone that projects a sense indifference or disinterest. Remember you should be excited about what you're presenting, it shouldn't be a chore.   

### Questions?
Asking or taking questions tend to work best if left till the end. The main reason being a lot of times the question gets answered within the presentation itself at some later point. And if you do stop to take questions, there is a chance that might turn into a side discussion/topic. 

Also by taking questions in the middle, that not only makes you context switch, but requires everyone else in the room to context switch. Try not to let one person break the train of thought of the room (sure there might be others in the room with the same question, but same principal should still apply). 

By just allowing a few questions to be answered, that gives the notion all questions are fair game during the presentation, and that just amplifies the points above. 

### Practice, Practice, Practice
This should go without saying, but everyone can benefit from a few dry runs. Whether its in front of a person or two, just by yourself, or even rehearsing what you're going to say in your head, it'll make you that much more prepare come the real thing. This is key in being able to clearly presenting your thoughts, and if you have a time limit, helps you stay within those limits.
