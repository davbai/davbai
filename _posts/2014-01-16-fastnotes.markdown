title:  "Fastnotes"
---

I spent a majority of my time in front of my laptop. For all the times where I need a pencil and paper to write down something quick (which are never around when you need them), I normally turn to my computer, open up Evernote, and type it in there. 

The problem is, while Evernote is a great product, it has since become kind of bloated and takes a decent amount of time to open. After it loads I also need to choose a notebook where I want to create this note. Most importantly though, I almost always never want to save these notes, they're just something quick I need to write down (a quick todo, a phone number given to me by customer support, etc.). Instead of manually deleting these or forgetting to delete them after I'm done I wish they could just delete/clear themselves. Weirdly enough, I pretty much wanted a non-persistent note app.

So I created [Fastnotes](http://www.fastnot.es). It's a minimalistic site that opens up as a blank note. My browser is always almost always open so it's quick to get to. No login needed and it autofocuses on the body of the note so I can start typing right away.

I originally had an alert pop up if you ever tried to close the page, just to remind me that this note is going to be lost forever or incase I was closing the page by accident. But that alert started to get annoying. To counter this, I removed it and started saving (locally in your browser) the most recent note when the page closes. When you open [fastnot.es](http://www.fastnot.es), you'll always start with a blank page, but you are given the option to go back to your previous [one] note. 

And just incase my short notes ever turn into something I actually want to save, there are a few options I can utilize to do that. I can email it, download it as a .txt file, or of course just copy and paste it into wherever I need the text to do.

It's super simple but it serves as a solution to a (albeit minor) problem I have. You can see it live at [www.fastnot.es](http://www.fastnot.es) and view the code at [GitHub](https://github.com/davbai/fastnotes).
